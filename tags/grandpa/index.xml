      <description>Growing up, I always saw my Thatha as my hero. He was a tall man with a dynamic personality. He could crack up any room with a simple wordplay. You could hear him guffaw along with the rest of the audience who&amp;rsquo;d be in splits.
Thatha, in his bachelor days, was a part of a real-fancy, popular drama troupe. On some boring summer afternoons, he&amp;rsquo;d tell us stories about the characters he&amp;rsquo;s played, the awards they&amp;rsquo;ve won and the famous people they&amp;rsquo;ve met.</description>
