If you're here by mistake or on purpose, here's what you should know about this. 
This is a personal blog where I usually ramble on about things that move me or tick me off. 
Brief list of topics include movies, people, food and culture. 
It is highly opinionated. It may or may not resonate with how you feel about things. 

For those of you I may piss off, my apoligies in advance. 

Have a great day.
